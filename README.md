### NoMoreDrop

**NoMoreDrop** revolutionizes Minecraft by eliminating block drops entirely! Break any block, and nothing will dropâ€”no items, no clutter, just pure simplicity. Perfect for unique survival challenges.

### Features

- Disables item drops from all blocks (stone, dirt, ore, etc.).
- Fully compatible with vanilla Minecraft and other mods.
- Lightweight and easy to install.

For the mod to work, it is not necessary for all players to install it. You need to download the mod only for the server (or the player who opens the world according to it).
